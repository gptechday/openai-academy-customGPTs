_Last updated: May 05, 2025_

Thank you for using **CiteRight** (“the Service”).  This privacy policy explains how we, **Muntaser Syed** (“we”, “our”, “us”), collect, use, and protect information when you interact with the Service.  
If you have any questions, contact us at **EMAIL HERE**.

## 1. What Data We Collect

| Category | Examples | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **User Inputs** | DOIs, URLs, titles, or slash‑commands you type into the chat. | To generate citations in your requested style. |
| **Usage Logs** | Timestamps, operation IDs (`lookup_by_id`, `search_by_title`), Crossref response codes, latency. | Debugging, performance analytics, abuse prevention. |
| **Minimal Metadata** | Your OpenAI user ID (hashed), GPT session ID. | Rate‑limiting, security auditing. |

**We do _not_ collect**: personal names (unless included in an author list), billing data, or precise location.

---

## 2. How We Use Data

1. **Generate citations** – Inputs are forwarded to the Crossref public API and formatted per your style request.  
2. **Improve reliability** – Aggregated, anonymized logs help us monitor error rates and latency.  
3. **Prevent misuse** – We detect patterns of automated scraping or disallowed content.

## 3. Data Retention

| Data type | Retention period | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| User Inputs | Ephemeral (auto‑deleted after response) | We do not store the content you submit. |
| Usage Logs | 30 days | Short‑term diagnostics. |
| Error Logs | 90 days (aggregated) | Trend analysis for uptime improvements. |

## 4. Data Sharing

* **Crossref** – Input queries are sent to Crossref (`api.crossref.org`) solely to retrieve bibliographic metadata.  
* **OpenAI** – The Service runs on OpenAI’s GPT platform; user inputs are processed under OpenAI’s terms.  
* **No third‑party marketing** – We do **not** sell or share data with advertisers or analytics providers.

---

## 5. Security Measures

* All traffic to Crossref uses **TLS 1.2+**.  
* Logs are stored in encrypted storage (AES‑256).  
* Access to operational dashboards is protected by 2‑factor authentication.

---

## 6. Your Choices

* Simply stop using the Service to cease data collection.  
* For log deletion requests, email **EMAIL HERE** with your session ID.
